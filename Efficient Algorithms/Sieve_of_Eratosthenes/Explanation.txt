The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer value, typically denoted as 
𝑛
n. It's a simple and efficient method, especially for relatively small values of 
𝑛
n. The algorithm follows these steps:

Initialize: Create a boolean array of size 
𝑛
+
1
n+1, initially marking all numbers as prime.

Starting from 2: Start with the first prime number, 2. Mark all multiples of 2 as non-prime. Since 2 is the smallest prime, all its multiples will be composite numbers.

Proceed to the next unmarked number: Move to the next unmarked number (greater than 2). This will be the next prime number.

Mark multiples of the prime: Mark all multiples of the current prime number as non-prime.

Repeat: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the square of the current prime exceeds 
𝑛
n.

Output: All unmarked numbers remaining in the list are prime.

Here's a step-by-step example:

Let's say we want to find all prime numbers up to 
𝑛
=
20
n=20.

We start with a boolean array representing numbers from 0 to 20, initially all marked as prime:

Copy code
2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Start with the first prime, which is 2. Mark all its multiples as non-prime:

Copy code
2  3  x  5  x  7  x  9 x 11 x 13 x 15 x 17 x 19 x
Move to the next unmarked number, which is 3. Mark all its multiples as non-prime:

Copy code
2  3  x  5  x  7  x  x x 11 x 13 x x x 17 x 19 x
Move to the next unmarked number, which is 5. Mark all its multiples as non-prime:

Copy code
2  3  x  5  x  7  x  x x 11 x 13 x x x 17 x 19 x
Move to the next unmarked number, which is 7. Mark all its multiples as non-prime. But we stop here since the square of 7 exceeds 20.

All unmarked numbers left are primes: 
2

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient method for finding primes, especially for relatively small values of 
𝑛
n. Its time complexity is

O(nloglogn), which is much better than checking each number individually for primality.

Sure, let's break down the code line by line:

cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
class Solution {: This declares a class named Solution.
public:: This specifies that the following members (functions and variables) will be accessible from outside the class.
int countPrimes(int n) {: This declares a member function countPrimes which takes an integer n as input and returns an integer.
cpp
Copy code
        if (n <= 2) return 0;
This line checks if n is less than or equal to 2. If it is, then there are no primes less than or equal to n, so it returns 0 immediately.
cpp
Copy code
        vector<bool> isPrime(n, true);
This line declares a vector isPrime of booleans, with n elements, all initialized to true. isPrime[i] will be true if i is considered prime, and false otherwise.
cpp
Copy code
        isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
Since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers, this line explicitly sets isPrime[0] and isPrime[1] to false.
cpp
Copy code
        for (int i = 2; i * i < n; ++i) {
This loop iterates from 2 up to the square root of n. This is because any composite number less than or equal to n must have a prime factor less than or equal to its square root.
cpp
Copy code
            if (isPrime[i]) {
Inside the loop, it checks if i is marked as prime in the isPrime array.
cpp
Copy code
                for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
If i is prime, this nested loop marks all multiples of i starting from i*i as non-prime. This is because smaller multiples of i will have already been marked as non-prime by previous iterations.
cpp
Copy code
                    isPrime[j] = false;
This line marks j as non-prime by setting isPrime[j] to false.
cpp
Copy code
                }
            }
        }
This loop continues until i * i is greater than or equal to n, marking multiples of all primes up to the square root of n.
cpp
Copy code
        int count = 0;
This line initializes a counter count to 0.
cpp
Copy code
        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
This loop iterates from 2 up to n - 1 to count the number of primes.
cpp
Copy code
            if (isPrime[i]) ++count;
Inside the loop, it increments count if i is marked as prime in the isPrime array.
cpp
Copy code
        }
This loop completes, counting all the primes.
cpp
Copy code
        return count;
    }
};
This line ends the function definition and the class definition.
