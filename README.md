# DSA Questions and Solutions Repository

Welcome to my DSA Questions and Solutions repository! This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems that I have solved from various platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. It serves as a resource for anyone looking to practice and improve their problem-solving skills in competitive coding.

## About

This repository contains a wide range of DSA problems categorized by topics. Each problem is accompanied by a solution, written in a clear and concise manner. The main goals of this repository are:

- To provide a comprehensive set of DSA problems for practice.
- To offer solutions that are easy to understand.
- To serve as a reference for common coding interview questions.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topics, with each topic having its own directory. Within each directory, you will find:

- A markdown file (`README.md`) with a list of problems related to that topic.
- Solution files for each problem, named after the problem title.

Here is an example structure:

```
